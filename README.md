# Introduction 

The Real-Time Audio Intelligence with Subtitle Overlay and PDF Summarization project is an advanced system designed to process audio input and provide meaningful insights in real time. This project integrates audio-to-text transcription, subtitle overlay, and automated PDF summarization based on the user preference, offering users a versatile tool for recording, transcribing, and summarizing audio data.

# Key Features
Users can select their preferred audio input source, including:

**Microphone Input**: Record audio directly using the system's microphone.

**Uploaded Audio Files**: Users can upload pre-recorded audio files in formats like .mp3, .wav, or .aac.
